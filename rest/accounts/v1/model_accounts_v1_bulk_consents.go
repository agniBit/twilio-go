	// A list of objects where each object represents the result of processing a `correlation_id`. Each object contains the following fields: `correlation_id`, a unique 32-character UUID that maps the response to the original request; `error_code`, an integer where 0 indicates success and any non-zero value represents an error; and `error_messages`, an array of strings describing specific validation errors encountered. If the request is successful, the error_messages array will be empty.
